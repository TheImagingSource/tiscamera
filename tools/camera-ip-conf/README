What is it?
-----------

camera-ip-conf is a tool that allows the ip configuration of GigE network cameras.
It offers the possibility to configure via cli or gui.

Examples
--------

To list all cameras:

   camera-ip-conf -l

Cameras can be named using the following methods:
   -s  --serial - The serial number of the camera
   -m  --mac    - The mac of the camera
   -n  --name   - The user defined name (assuming the name is not empty)

To get information about a single camera:

   camera-ip-conf -i -s <CAMERA_SERIAL>

To set the name of a camera:

   camera-ip-conf set name="CAMERA_NAME" -s <CAMERA_SERIAL>

To delete the name simply set it to an empty name

   camera-ip-conf set name="" -s <CAMERA_SERIAL>

To set the static ip configuration of a camera:

   camera-ip-conf set ip=192.168.100.100 subnet=255.255.0.0 gateway=192.168.100.1

To toggle static ip usage:

   camera-ip-conf set static=on -s <CAMERA_SERIAL>

To upload a new firmware:

   camera-ip-conf upload firmware=<FILE> -s <CAMERA_SERIAL>

   CAUTION: This can break your camera. Use at own risk!


Troubleshooting
---------------

    O My camera is not detected.
      If your camera is not detected, there are various possible reasons.
      - Assure the camera responds as expected.
        This can be done via wireshark. If an gvcp pong arrives, the
        camera responds correctly.
      - Turn of your firewall.
        It could be filtered
      - Turn of rp_filter
        rp_filter is a kernel module that drops packets from addresses
        that are not within the address range of your network. If your
        camera happens to use LLA or a static IP not within your
        network. This may be the reason.
        To temporarly turn off the rp_filter execute:
        ====================
        sudo sysctl -w net.ipv4.conf.all.rp_filter=0
        ====================

    O I misconfigured my camera.
      If the camera has a temporary IP configuration and is not
      reachable a simple reconnecting of the camera should reset the
      configuration.

      If the static ip is misconfigured and the camera has a address
      that can not be represented in a reliable way (e.g. broadcast
      addresses such as 192.168.0.255/24), execute
      ====================
      camera-ip-conf rescue ip=<IP> subnet=<SUBNET> gateway=<GATEWAY> mac=<MAC>
      ====================

      To get the mac address of your camera use tools like wireshark
      to listen to incoming traffic. Your camera should still send
      pong packets as a response to the discovery pings.
